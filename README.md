# My personal portfolio page

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  This page is intended to be a replacement for my old portfolio, which can still be found in the repo [https://github.com/superking84/superking84-old.github.io](https://github.com/superking84/superking84-old.github.io).  That portfolio was several years old and was a showcase of my abilities at the time as an aspiring junior developer.

Now, in 2022, I am a professional software developer, and I'm looking to update my portfolio mainly as a means of learning new (new to me) technologies that I don't currently get to use professionally.  Thus, the projects on here are going to be learning exercises for me more than anything.

## Current Projects

### Wordle Clone

A pretty basic clone of the wildly popular game "Wordle". Currently only working on desktop (it *works* on mobile but the sizing is all off).   There are still some improvements to be made, including improvements to the word list, animations, and responsiveness on smaller devices.
