# My personal portfolio page

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  This page is intended to be a replacement for my old portfolio, which can still be found in the repo [https://github.com/superking84/superking84-2016.github.io](https://github.com/superking84/superking84-2016.github.io).  That portfolio was several years old and was a showcase of my abilities at the time as an aspiring junior developer.

Now, in 2022, I am a professional software developer, and I'm looking to update my portfolio mainly as a means of learning new (new to me) technologies that I don't currently get to use professionally.  Thus, the projects on here are going to be learning exercises for me more than anything.

## Current Projects

### Wordle Clone

A pretty basic clone of the wildly popular game "Wordle". There are still some improvements that could be made, but I've gotten a pretty good working version up that is responsive on a decent variety of mobile devices. 

### Conway's Game of Life

The famous "zero-player" cellular automata game, which is one of my favorite projects to write on whatever front-end tech I'm learning at any given moment.  It's a bit wonky looking on mobile, and it's best viewed on desktop for now.
